Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my Master's thesis project on "Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Solving Financial Question Answering." (Thesis proposal can be found [here]([URL_to_PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RwhxiKaxM6iNle0W6TWJaRAExnXCWjCV/view?usp=sharing))
)
This research project, conducted at the Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, explores the integration of case-based reasoning (CBR) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of financial question answering systems.

The focus of this thesis is to tackle the inherent complexities of financial documents, which include a mix of textual, tabular, and numerical data, by employing a novel strategy that leverages similar past cases to inform current question answering tasks. 
This approach aims to address the shortcomings of existing models in processing complex, multimodal information and to push the boundaries of what's achievable with large language models and sequence-to-sequence frameworks in the domain of financial QA.

In this repository, you'll find the codebase, datasets, and methodologies used in our experiments, along with detailed documentation on the project's objectives, preliminary findings, and the implications of our research. 
Our work encompasses a thorough investigation into the nuances of case retrieval using bi-encoder and cross-encoder architectures and the integration of retrieved cases into the program generation process for solving financial QA tasks with increased accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

I invite fellow researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in the intersection of NLP, artificial intelligence, and financial analytics to explore this repository. 
Your insights, feedback, and contributions towards advancing this research are highly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find this project both informative and inspiring.
